# Build your CI-CD Pipeline Azure DevOps

Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines will improve software’s frequent delivery by adapting Azure DevOps services. A CI/CD pipeline will perform automated monitoring and controlling over the application’s delivery to improve its integration and testing phases. 

Continuous Integration(CI) is an automated process that allows any code changes in code to an application to be regularly developed, tested, and merged to a shared repository. Continuous Delivery(CD) represents the deployment of artifacts into the production environment. This will automatically test the bug and upload it to a repository.

This hands-on practical session explains the building and executing procedure of the CI/CD pipeline in a real-time working environment system. Through this project, we will see the complete lifecycle of the application at a high level.
